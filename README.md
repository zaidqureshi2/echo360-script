#Echo360 auto answer script

If you have a lecture that requires you to answer at least one question to mark attendance on echo360 copy the script from [answerQuestion.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaidqureshi2/echo360-script/master/answerQuestion.js) and paste into a plugin such as Custom JavaScript for webpages.

I did it in chrome.

##How to use

1. Install the [Custome JavaScript](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija?hl=en) plugin in chrome. 
2. Go to your echo360.org.uk page
3. Click on cjs on the top right corner and paste the script from [answerQuestion.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaidqureshi2/echo360-script/master/answerQuestion.js)
4. Go to the slides that has the answer.

##Future versions

At the moment this only works if the first page has the hidden question. Will improve to search slides and wait.
